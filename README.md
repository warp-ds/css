# CSS

This is the CSS package for WARP.

The package includes only resets for now.

## Usage

The CSS should be used directly from Eik. This is because we can alias releases by major versions.

We publish 2 versions of resets. The minified that can be used in production and non-minified that can be used in development.

```html
<link href="https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@warp-ds/css/v1/resets.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
or
<link href="https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@warp-ds/css/v1/resets.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
